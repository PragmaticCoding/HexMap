# StarterFX
## A Simple Basic Skeleton To Start a JavaFX Project

This is a minimal implementation of a project structure to get a complete, working JavaFX application up and running. 

So far, this has been tested in Intellij Idea, and works.

## How To Use This Project

Download the project and open it in your IDE, which should then detect the Gradle structure and begin setting up the project components.  When this is completed, go to the Gradle menu and, under "Build", select "Build".  This should download any necessary libraries and complete successfully.

Then, from the Gradle menu, under "Application", select "Run".  This should run the application and you should see the following:

That's it!  The build is good and you're ready to start building your application.
